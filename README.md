**`Virtual Pioneer  (Programmer, Pentester, Problem Solver)`**


Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Harry Derderian, a passionate computer science student with a deep curiosity for the ever-evolving world of cyberspace. Driven by a desire to continually learn and grow, I dive into side projects that not only test my programming skills but also enhance my problem-solving abilities.
My journey into cybersecurity has been particularly excitingâ€”Iâ€™ve actively participated in capture the flag (CTF) competitions and even placed top 3 in a mock penetration testing tournament. Whether Iâ€™m exploring the binary depths of software to uncover buffer overflow exploits or crafting innovative projects with Python, Iâ€™m committed to expanding my knowledge and skills in all facets of programming and cybersecurity.
